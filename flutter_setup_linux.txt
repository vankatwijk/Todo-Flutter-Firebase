you need to install android studio first and have android sdk  / 10+ api level 29 and greater

//its better to download the .tar file and not the snap so you are able to point to the path correctly
sudo snap install flutter --classic

flutter doctor
//if you see a license problem after the running doctor run :
flutter doctor --android-licenses
if you see a java error then you have the wrong sdk / api level nstalled, check android studio

 // useful commands
flutter create 'PATH_TO_YOUR_APP_FOLDER'
flutter run
